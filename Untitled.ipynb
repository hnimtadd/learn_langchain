The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps.

Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes.

Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model.

The algorithm overview of DARTS.

      "page_content='DARTS is able to greatly reduce the cost of GPU hours. Their experiments for searching for CNN cells have $N=7$ and only took 1.5 days with a single GPU. However, it suffers from the high GPU memory consumption issue due to its continuous representation of network architecture. In order to fit the model into the memory of a single GPU, they picked a small $N$.\\nTo constrain the GPU memory consumption, ProxylessNAS (Cai et al., 2019) views NAS as a path-level pruning process in DAG and binarizes the architecture parameters to force only one path to be active between two nodes at a time. The probabilities for an edge being either masked out or not are then learned by sampling a few binarized architectures and using BinaryConnect (Courbariaux et al., 2015) to update the corresponding probabilities. ProxylessNAS demonstrates a strong connection between NAS and model compression.
